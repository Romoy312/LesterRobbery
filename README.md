Change the random spawn locations from Config.Locations
Change the items in the trunk from Config.TruckItems
Change the cooldown from Config.Cooling
Config.CoolDown is the one that displays how much time is on the cooldown so only change the value infront of the "/"
Config.Models is the one that deals with what objects are targetable and triggers the hack
Config.Distance is how far away the person can be from the laptop to start the hack

Everything else is not in use at the moment

Just a simple Script
